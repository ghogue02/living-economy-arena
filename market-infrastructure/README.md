## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install asyncio numpy websockets logging
```

### Quick Start
```python
from main import MarketInfrastructureOrchestrator

# Create and start infrastructure
orchestrator = MarketInfrastructureOrchestrator()

# Initialize all components
await orchestrator.initialize_infrastructure()

# Start the market infrastructure
await orchestrator.start_infrastructure()
```
