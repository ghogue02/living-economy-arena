# Player Interaction Systems

## Overview
The Player Interaction Systems provide mechanisms for players to indirectly control and influence the autonomous AI agent economy through various policy tools, infrastructure investments, and manipulation tactics.

## System Components

### Core Engine
- Policy implementation engine
- Influence calculation systems
- Player control interfaces

### Policy Tools
- Taxation systems
- Regulatory frameworks
- Subsidy mechanisms
- Trade restrictions

### Infrastructure Systems
- Market efficiency investments
- Transportation networks
- Communication systems
- Research facilities

### Influence Systems
- Propaganda/marketing campaigns
- Insider information networks
- Political manipulation
- Natural disaster triggers

### Espionage & Intelligence
- Market intelligence gathering
- Competitor surveillance
- Trade secret theft
- Economic warfare

### Alliance Systems
- Player cooperation mechanics
- Treaty frameworks
- Betrayal mechanics
- Resource sharing

## Integration Points
- **Economic Engine**: Policy effects on agent behaviors
- **AI Personality**: Influence on agent decision-making
- **Market Infrastructure**: Infrastructure impact on trading
- **Game Balance**: Preventing exploitation and maintaining fairness
- **Security**: Anti-cheat for manipulation detection

## Player Control Philosophy
Players cannot directly control AI agents but can create environmental conditions that influence agent behaviors through:
- Economic incentives/disincentives
- Information availability
- Market structure changes
- Regulatory environments
- Infrastructure quality
